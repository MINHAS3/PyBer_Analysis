The difficulties that I was faced was were how to properly make the chart and add each code properly to the plot. Being able to plot each cell without errors was the most complicated because if a line were not defined properly then the next cell would have an error and not run. Defining the codes was a bit time consuming however once they ran properly, I was able to get the results needed. The technical steps that went into resolving issues were properly identifying errors, correcting them by reviewing each cell assuring the sequence for each code was arranged to define the result that was needed. 

When making the chart adjusting and placing the columns to align with the line graph to show the results that were needed. The adjustments were to properly add the legend, colors, city, and fares. The steps that I took to correct the problems were first gathered the information needed to make the chart. Second, I set the layout of the graph by placing the columns in the correct order. Third, I placed the order of how each item should be on the chart. Lastly, once all I had my code written I ran the code to display the chart resulting in a defined line chart.

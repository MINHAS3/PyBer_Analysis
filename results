# PyBer Analysis Report
This PyBer Analysis reports shows the trends of ride sharing market in different areas of the city. 
## Background and Results
The background and results are of how different areas can effect the pricing of the travel different communities.

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to show the breakdown of rider data from different parts of the city.
### Technical Analysis
I was able to match the codes to able to better understand the data with the graphs and charts. 
The different graphs and charts represent each category allowing us to determine how to easily expand services in areas where it is needed the most. 
It showed the trends that otherwise would be missed. 
### Results
The results showed how the trends in the market were different in each of the months. The chart showed the peaks to low points in the rider riding trends. 
It shows how riders trends vary in each of the areas of the city. https://github.com/MINHAS3/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/Fig2.png
### Summary
The summary of the reports and charts will allow the analysist to easily identify the trends.

## Challenges Encountered and Overcome
I overcome the challenges by reviewing the coding scripts to formulate the proper lines to complete the code. 
I used resources such as YouTube, my classmates, TA's, tutor and examples given in the modules working through them repeatedly to correct any mistakes to properly run the code. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges that I faced were gathering the information and creating the charts. The charts were a bit complicated to organize and arrange in the order that were required. 
Inputting the proper data to build the charts, getting the correct percentages and accurately combining the DataFrame for the charts. 
* Programming

* Data analysis

* Graphing, etc

### Technical Analyses Used
The technical anaylsis used were charts and the tables to shows the results. 
## Recommendations and Next Steps
The next steps would be to clearly use diagrams to clearly state the charts that are clearly labeled with explainations. 
### Recommendations for Future Analysis
The recommendations for future analysis are that analysist thoroughly review each code to be inputted in order to explain to the team or company.
